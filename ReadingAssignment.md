# Basic Web Techniques

## Reading Assignment - Basic Html and Css

### Objective

This week's reading assignment is to get you deeper into terms concerning html and to make you familiar with basic terms of Cascading Style Sheets (css).

### Materials

Review the handouts of the last lecture (what is basically a summary of the presentation shown) and check the [html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [css](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) tutorial of [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com). Although most of the information on [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) is fine and helpful, there is a small number of parts which are misleading or sometimes not even according to the standard. Furthermore, some material presented at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) is too detailed for our current level of knowledge. Therefore, we recommend to read only the parts listed in the following two sections and to take care of the hints we sometimes add to the links.

#### Html

1. [Basics](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)
2. [Html elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp): Be careful that the information about "empty elements" is not according to the spec. Following the W3C specification we call them *void elements*.
3. [Attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)
4. [Headings](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp)
5. [Paragraphs](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp): Again be careful when using the ``<br>`` element. Doing line breaks in this style should be only at very rare occasions. Most of the time it is clearer to start a new paragraph with the text you want to have separated by a new line.
6. [Comments](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp)
7. [Links](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp): Skip the following sections:
